These are the results used in the paper.

The plain-text results are in the .txt files.

The more detailed results are stored in the corresponding python files,
and running those files prints out the results in pretty format.

  python3 saved_startups_results_1.py
prints out the same output as is stored in paper_startups_results_3.txt.
In addition, it plots the welfare and revenue of the scenarios.
